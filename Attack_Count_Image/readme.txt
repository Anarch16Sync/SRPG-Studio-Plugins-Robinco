There are two versions of this script, depending on whether you are also using no-counter-pursuit.js as well. If you are NOT using no-counter-pursuit.js, then use the -1 file. If you are, then use the -2 file.

For the plugin to work, you must also move the AttackCount folder into the Materials folder of your project.
